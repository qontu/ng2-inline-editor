## Installation
A recommended way of installing **ngx-inline-editor** with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@qontu/ngx-inline-editor) using the following command:

`npm i @qontu/ngx-inline-editor --save`

## Configure styles

Include the basic theme or configure your own styles. To use the basic theme using *angular-cli*, you can import the css rules into *angular-cli*'s file `src/styles.css` using this line:

`@import '~@qontu/ngx-inline-editor/themes/bootstrap.css'`

{{% notice info %}}
We use some classes of [Twitter Bootstrap](http://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/) and [FontAwesome](http://fontawesome.io/) to perform the icons of buttons. You need to include them or customize your own style.
