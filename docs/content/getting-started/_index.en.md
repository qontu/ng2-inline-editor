## Welcome to our docs!

**ngx-inline-editor**  is a library developed in Angular 4 (version 4.x.x), 
with this component you are able to create editable elements. This technique is also known as _click-to-edit_ or _edit-in-place_.
This component is based on ideas of [angular-xeditable](https://github.com/vitalets/angular-xeditable) which is developed in AngularJS.

## Version
Angular 4 is now stable. Therefore, if encountering errors using this lib, ensure your version of Angular is compatible. 
The current version used to develop this lib is angular4 `^4.0.0`.

## Dependencies
Basically it does not depend on any libraries except Angular4 itself. 

For themes you need to include [Twitter Bootstrap](http://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/) and [FontAwesome](http://fontawesome.io/) in your project.
